## Intro
The Cat Photography Tips Website is intended to guide people who wants to take better photos of their cats or pets in some very basic photography steps. A small "how to" site just to get them started in expolring the world of pet photography.


## Features User Experience
__Index / Homepage__
![Indexpage as imagined](<Indexpage image.png>) 
On the index-page I wanted the User to get some basic photographic tips. I also added a link to wikipedia explaining the rule of thirds. Hopefully this will improve the quality of photos for the User, as well as ignite a spark of quriosity regaring the wide world of photography.

__Gallery page__
![Gallerypage as imagined](<Gallerypage image.png>) 
On the gallery page I added some of my own photos as examples for the User to explain more in detail how the photos were taken, thus giving the User a larger understanding for and some more tips on how to take good pictures of their pets.

__Contact page__
![IContactpage as imagined](<Contactpage image.png>)
On the contact page, the User finds my email and my phonenumber.
They may also subscribe to an weekly email with commersial material.
As the User surely have further questions and a newborn passion for photography, they will be eager to recieve emails with relevant likns.
I also assure them their personal data is safe with me.



### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes linksto the Home page, Gallery and Contact page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.

  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. 
  
  __Logotype__
  The logo-name in the header is clickable on every page so whenever clicked it returns to the home-page.

- __The Footer__ 
As you notice as you scroll down the pages, the header is always present with its links.
The footer is not showing until one has scrolled to the very bottom of the page, this to save some screen-space and avoid distraction.
Whitin the footer element the User finds social media links so they can follow my other channels for even more valuable tips.

### Features Left to Implement

- In the future I would have added a video-page with photography tutorials.
- Also a merchandise-page to sell high quality photo equipment to the user. 

## Testing 

![menu bar missing and three columns of photos](<The navigation menu is not showing.png>)
I have used Dev-tools in Google Chrome to check how the pages respond to diffrent sizes.
For example I have done a lot of testing to get the gallery-page to work good. 
I also wanted the navigation bar to become an burger-menu for the smaller screen-sizes.
Here we see that the buger nav-toggle is missing, We also see there being three columns of photos, at these smaller sizes I want them to be only two.

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project. 

### Content

- Instructions on how to implement form validation on the Sign Up page was taken from [Specific YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/)
- The icons in the footer were taken from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

### Media

- The photos used on the home and sign up page are from This Open Source site
- The images used for the gallery page were taken from this other open source site

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
