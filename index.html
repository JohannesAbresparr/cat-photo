                <p>

                    of your cat or other pet!
                    As the occurence of social media has exploded during the resent decades,
                    and as our cellphones has been equipped with more and more improved cameras,
                    this is a time where we all want to take beautiful pictures to share with our friends and family.

                <h3>Focus point</h3>
                <p>
                    The first tip is to get the focus right, where in the photo the focus point is set, it will be sharp.
                    Have you ever tried to take a close-up photo of your animal, ending up getting a very blurry furball somewhere and 
                    a very sharp background in the photo? This is because the camera has set it's focus in the background.
                    On most modern day cellphones, as you start your camera, you can touch the screen and the auto-focus will 
                    shift to the where you pointed. Have a go and see if your focus point shifted! PS: It can sometimes be better not
                    to be too close to the object you focus on, start vith 50cm (20") and see how close you can come with your camera.
