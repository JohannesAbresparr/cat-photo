                <p>
                    On this site you will find some useful tips on how to take beautiful photos with your cellphone
                    camera
                    of your cat or other pets!
                    As the occurence of social media has exploded during the resent decades,
                    and as our cellphones has been equipped with more and more improved cameras,
                    this is a time where we all want to take beautiful pictures to share with our friends and family.

                <h3 class="tip" id="tip1" aria-label="tip 1 focus point">Tip #1 Focus point</h3>
                <p>
                    The first tip is to get the focus right, where in the photo the focus point is set, it will be
                    sharp.
                    Have you ever tried to take a close-up photo of your animal, ending up getting a very blurry furball
                    somewhere and
                    a very sharp background in the photo? This is because the camera has set it's focus in the
                    background.
                    On most modern day cellphones, as you start your camera, you can touch the screen and the auto-focus
                    will
                    shift to the spot where you pointed. Have a go and see if your focus point shifts! PS: It can
                    sometimes be better not
                    to be too close to the object you focus on, start with 50cm (20") and see how close you can come
                    with your camera.DS.

                    Tip #2 Wright with light
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Photo stands for Light and Graphy stands for Write. In other words photography menas "to wright with
                    light".
                    By default your camera tries to find the "middle" of the light resources avaliable, this means for
                    insance, if your cat is sitting in the window on a
                    bright and sunny day, and you are behind your cat, trying to take a photo. The camera "wants" both
                    the sunlit outdoor fields and sky as well as
                    the inside of your window and your perhaps dark cat to have the same "exposure value". Therefore you
                    end up with a too dark image where you see the
                    outside clouds, but your cat is a bit too dark.

                    On most modern cellphone-camera-applications you can set the auto exposure point just as easily as
                    you set your focus.
                    Did you notice in the previous tip, as you set your focus point, it appearing a line with a dot in
                    the middle and a sun-symbol?
                    If you press on the dot and pull it up or down or side to side, depending on your camera
                    application, this will change the amount of light
                    your camera letts in. In other words, your black cat in the window might be 'purrfectly' lit, but
                    your outside view might be as one say "burned out".
                    Now try to adjust the light setting as well as the focus point.
                    You can also experiment with the flash, if you want to keep the background AND the motive well lit.
                    But my advice to you is not to use the flash
                    close to your animal! but instead let the natural light illuminate your photos.
                    PS: Toggle off the automatic flash by pressing the flash icon that is crossed over. DS.

                    and rulers to follow</h3>
                <p>
                    Ever heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                        aria-label="Rule of thirds on wikipedia, opens in new tab">the rule of thirds?</a> that states
                    that an image should
                    be "divided" into nine equally big squares? For instance the horizon could be aligned along the
                    "dividing line" between the two upper lines of squares and the line of squares on the bottom, thus
                    creating a more harmonius image rather than
                    had it been in the exact middle of the photo.
                    In your phone's camera application, you will hopefully find the setting where you can see lines on
                    the screen as you line up your camera to take the photo.
                    This could help you line up your photo. But then again, maby some rules are made to be broken?
                    See if you find the setting where you can see the lines / grid as you take your photo.

                <p>
                    Now that you have taken your photography to a new level, do not be afraid to experiment.
                    My advice to you is to take lots and lots of photos and then,
                    (when the cat gets tired of you and leave the well lit window)
                    you can look at the photos in your gallery and choose which to save and which to delete.
                    Now is also the time to look at the functions in your gallery-application.
                    Here, often the function-icon, has the form of a pencil, you will find that you can edit your
                    photos once more with diffrent filters and light settings. Play around with these but try not to
                    add too much sharpening, it is better to have set the focus as described in the first tip.

                    Here however, you will also find the crop-function. the function icon often depicted as two angles
                    lined up as a square
                    with dotted lines fron where the lines meet.
                    This is very useful so that you can straighten up your photos. and also flip them
                    90&deg;
                    at a time if you see needed.

                    Go on and test out the functions of your gallery application.
